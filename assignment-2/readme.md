### What is a Version Control ?

Version Control helps manage all your file for your projects. Every change is saved in the repository and if need be, can be recovered for future reference.
Since the program allows you to work on files at the same time from any location and device, it is extremely collaborative.

### This Cycle's Workflow

During this cycle, I quickly went through the material over the weekend.
I am glad that I fianally got access to assignment 2. I wasn't sure if there was somthing wrong but I am glad to hear that it was down just for updates. I am extermely excited for this class this semester, especially since I recently started a new job as a web and content designer on campus.
