1. You can only have one <head> and <body> elements per page in HTML5.
The <head> element contains all the metadata or information about the page.
The <body> element contains all of the content that will show up in your browser window.

2. Structural markup is setting up the main structure of the webpage. Whereas semantic is all of  the other elements that are do not affect the structure.
