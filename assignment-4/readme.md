1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans

* divs: defines a section in an HTML document.
* classes:  an attribute that is used to define styles for elements with the same class name.
* ids: an attribute that specifies a unique id for an HTML element and is unique to that document.
* spans: an inline container for phrasing content.

2. What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

The Alt text is the alternate text to discribe an image when it is not able to be display properly.
It is also iportant because people with visual diabilities who use screenreaders are able to know what is being displayed. Accesiblity to those who have disabilities are so very important when it comes to web pages.

3.  Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

 This work cycle was pretty easy. I actually picked the exact same song as another student whih I found the odds to be quite funny but I guess we are both very excited abou the new Twentyone Pilots album.
