With my fingers in your mouth
You're only speaking vowels
And I like it
And with your hand around my throat
I don't wanna see you go
'Cause I like it
I took one too many
Now I got to stay up all night
Or else I'm done for
I'm done for

I'm in love with Tyler Durden
That's why this shit ain't never working for me
I'm in love with a fantasy

This is your life and it's ending
One minute at a time
So what you gonna do?
Yeah, what you gonna do?
I've had one too many for you to take me down
So you gonna need to keep me up or I'ma fall down

And I'm in love with Tyler Durden
That's why this shit ain't never working for me
I'm in love with a fantasy
'Cause I'm in love with Tyler Durden
That's why none of this
No, none of it's ever working
