          <p>Native to the Rocky Mountains, my love of nature and gorgeous scenery became a big part of my life from early on. It was always home to me, but it wasn’t always where I lived. Having moved around multiple times during my childhood, I got to experience wonderful, new, and exciting things that most children wouldn’t have had the opportunity to. I have lived in major cities such as Portland OR, Vancouver WA, and Denver CO, as well as many others. Having grown up in such art abundant communities, my love of fine art and music grew. Since I moved quite a bit and traveled a lot, I was homeschooled for eleven years of my educational career and am now studying Media Arts and Voice Performance at the University of Montana. Being homeschooled gave me the opportunity to focus on art and music in a nurtured and supportive environment surrounded by friends and family. Large influences in my art would be my love of video games, animation, Japanese culture, science fiction and films. My mediums include, but are not limited to, watercolors, pen and ink, acrylic paints, pencils, and adobe creative cloud.
