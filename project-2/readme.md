I particularly liked going over the technical structure of a website and figuring out the building blocks in which it has been built. The HTML of a site is really the skeleton and the CSS is the flesh. Iâ€™m really looking forward to fleshing out my ideas and designs even further with CSS in the next module

This work cycle was a bit of a pain. I couln't figure out why my css wasn't affecting all my pages. It happened to be one period that I had b=missed when linking the pages. I was so excited when I figured it out. I jumped up and might have possibly yelled for joy.
