### Ariyana Pilskalns

I am so happy to be done. This class was a blast and i learned so much, but like allgood think they inevitably come to end. This final project was a lot of fun styling and nothing feels better than the satisfaction of working code.
I currently work as a web designer so this class really expanded upon my knowlege of HTML and CSS.
