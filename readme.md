I am taking this class to learn basic web design. I want to become more fluent in HTML and CSS. It is also a required course for my degree.

+ I forgot how labor intesive it was to set up the cables to connect other nations togther ( I had seen the videos before)
+ I wish more credit would go to those who have created such revolutionary technology such as the internet.
+ I think more people should have this basic understanding of what they are using on a daily basis, such ad the internet.
